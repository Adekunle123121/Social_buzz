# Social_buzz

I participated in the open access Accenture Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program with Forage. Where I worked as a data analyst to help an organization called 
"Social Buzz" to analyze their and help them with data driven decision.

##  Introduction
Social Buzz is a fast growing social media organization, Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds. Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively. Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. Out of the 250 people working at Social Buzz, 200 of them are technical staff working on maintaining thishighly complex technology.

## Data Collection
I got the dataset from https://www.theforage.com/virtual-experience/hzmoNKtzvAzXsEqx8/accenture-north-america/data-analytics-virtual-experience/data-cleaning-modeling for my internship program with forage. I was provided seven datasets to work on and each dataset contains different columns and values.

## Tools used 
Excel and Power BI

## Skills demonstrated
# Data cleaning
The data cleaning was done on excel. After understanding the business, I then cleaned the datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for the problem.
# Data modelling 
After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, I went ahead to model the data into a dataset that can precisely answer the business questions and produce the results needed.
# Data analysis 
With our new dataset, we used our analytical expertise to 
uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the 
insights.
